# LadsMod

INSTALLATION GUIDE:
download any 1.8.8 or 1.8.9 forge version.
Navigate to .minecraft located in %appdata% (C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming). 
Drop LadsMod.jar into mods folder and launch.

If you find any issues or bugs please submit an issues report in this repo: https://github.com/LADLADLAD1/LadsMod.

I'm planning to update the mod eventually, understand that coding (especially alone) takes a while and that I have to do college prep.

If you plan to use the source to make your own additions to the mod, or to sample code, feel free to do so but mention me in credits.

One last thing, if you have any suggestion or improvement to make (assuming it's not extremely hard to make), I will gladly consider adding it to the mod.
